# Hangman
Own Java version

This is one of the first times I have tried to design my own classes and combine them.
I have recreated the popular Hangman game, adding a JPanel and a JMenuBar to a JFrame. The drawings representing the stickman are my own work and could have been done better. Also, the list of words can be much bigger. I could extend the app by adding descriptions to words and giving them as hints maybe.
Enjoy.
